"Ultramono" is a wide, geometric, and stylishly beautiful monospaced typeface. Each letter is poorly- I mean carefully designed to grab the viewers' attention and make the design stands out. "Ultramono" is perfect for posters, logos, headings, titles, etc. Lighter weights can also be used for small blocks of text, although some adjustments might be needed for legibility improvement.
The whole family consists of a whopping 16 styles, with 8 weights ranging from Light to Black and their italic companions. 8 of which are entirely free for personal and commercial uses. Each font contains 480 glyphs, including Latin and Cyrillic.
